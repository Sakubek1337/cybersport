            Natus Vincere were by far the favorites to take the tournament title from the start of the event, having demonstrated stellar form in the months prior by winning IEM Cologne and ESL Pro League Season 14. That expectation only became more realized as Valeriy "⁠B1T⁠" Vakhovskiy entered the Stockholm group stage in powerful form, ending the top sixteen stage as the best-performing player of the entire event with a 1.44 rating.

          <p class="info-width mx-auto">At the moment, we don't know for sure when PUBG Mobile's 1.6 Update - which should start what we're calling Season 22 - will drop. We can make an educated guess though, based on the fact that PUBG Mobile is updated roughly every two months.
The most recent PUBG Mobile update was released a couple of days before the previous Royale Pass ended - With this in mind, we could see PUBG Mobile's 1.6 Update drop around September 10th."</p>

          <p class="info-width mx-auto">The first map was Bind and Envy came in strong straight out of the gate. They won the first two rounds, and we think that there were a few people watching that were thinking that Envy might be able to keep their win streak going. Gambit weren’t going to make it that easy. The first half of the map was an absolute knockdown, drag out fight but Envy managed to reach the end of the half with a two-round lead. It wouldn’t stay that way for long. Envy managed to push the map into overtime, but Gambit came away with the win.

The second map, Haven, was a little bit more one sided. Envy managed to hold out in the first half but never managed to gain a real foothold. This map never made it into overtime and Gambit took the win yet again.

The final map was brutal. Team Envy knew that this was their last chance to turn the game around. If Gambit won again, they would win the overall series. They gave it their all in the first half, with both teams winning an equal number of rounds. Unfortunately, it looked like Envy were running out of steam, they used up all of their energy in the first half and fell to Gambit in the second.

Gambit Esports have been crowned the winner of the Valorant Masters Berlin. They take home $225,000 in prize money and bragging rights as the top Valorant team in the world. They might not have that title for long. Both Gambit and Envy have secured enough points to make it to the Champions. It won’t be long before they square off against one another again and we are betting that Envy will bring their A game.</p>

          <p class="info-width mx-auto">It's official – Team Spirit are the Dota 2 World Champions. The Russian squad lifted the Aegis of Champions at The International 10 after defeating PSG.LGD 3-2. But just how did this Cinderella story come to fruition?
It seems hard to believe now that Team Spirit nearly didn't even make it to The International 10 after failing to secure enough Dota Pro Circuit points during the regular season. The team then found themselves down 2-1 in the finals of the open qualifiers, just one game away from never making it. Now they’re the champions.</p>
